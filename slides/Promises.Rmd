# Intro

- R is *single* *threaded*

- We can only perform one task at a time

- Whilst your R session is running, it can't do anything else. 

- This is called *synchronous* *programming*

---

# Example: A simple function

Here we have a simple function, that performs linear regression on two variables within the movies data set. 

```{r}
library("ggplot2movies")
data(movies, package = "ggplot2movies")

display = function(){
  Sys.sleep(5)
  fit = lm(rating ~ year,data = movies)
  return(fit)
}
```

Notice the `Sys.sleep(5)`!!

---

# Example: A simple function

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("tictoc")

tic()
display()
toc()
```

Whilst this function is running, we cannot run any other code, i.e. one task at a time!

# Introducing **future**

- Function `future()` which runs R code in a separate process, leaving free the original process

```{r}
library("future")
plan(multiprocess)

tic()
fit = future(display())
toc()
```

- Now running `display()` takes close to 0 seconds. 

- `plan(multiprocess)` tells **future** to use a separate R session on the same machine to run futures. This is essential. Only have to run this *once* per session.

---

# Introducing **future**

- Whilst we now have a asynchronous way of running tasks, accessing the results of tasks is still synchronous

```{r}
tic()
fit = future(display())
value(fit)
toc()
```

## Controlling How Futures are Resolved
The future package implements the following types of futures:

| Name            | OSes        | Description
|:----------------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------
| _synchronous:_  |             | _non-parallel:_
| `sequential`    | all         | sequentially and in the current R process
| `transparent`   | all         | as sequential w/ early signaling and w/out local (for debugging)
| _asynchronous:_ |             | _parallel_:
| `multiprocess`  | all         | multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
| `multisession`  | all         | background R sessions (on current machine)
| `multicore`     | not Windows | forked R processes (on current machine)
| `cluster`       | all         | external R sessions on current, local, and/or remote machines
| `remote`        | all         | Simple access to remote R sessions

---

## A few useful things:

### How many cores do I have available?

```{r}
availableCores()
```

### Is my future resolved yet?

```{r}
resolved(fit) 
```

---

# Introducing **promises**

```{r}
library("promises")
```

- Lets us asynchronously access results of tasks

- Whilst the task is running, a promise object represents the **eventual** result of the task

- When the task has run, a promise object represents the result of the task

- You cannot ask a promise if it's done

- You cannot ask a promise for it's value

---

# Introducing **promises**

Instead of extracting the value from a promise, we chain operations to the results. For instance, chaining *synchronously* using the **magrittr** pipe without futures/promises

```{r}
display() %>% 
  print()
```

---

# Introducing **promises**

Now chaining *asynchronously* using the pipe from **promises**

```{r}
future(display()) %...>% 
  print()
```

## Exercise

From this repository open `promises/demo_sync/app.R`.
Run the app and notice that the button causes a synchronous generation of output.

Use `future()` and `%...>%` to generate the output and access it asynchronously.

**Hints:** 

- Load the libraries then call `plan(multiprocess)`
