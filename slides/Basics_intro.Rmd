# Chapter 1: What is markdown?
---

# What is markdown?

  * Markdown: lightweight markup language.

  * Plain and simple
    * [Github](github.com), wiki's, [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com)

  * Simple and fast to write
    * I use it for agendas, minutes & reports


---

# R markdown (.Rmd)

  * [R markdown](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rm-cheatsheet.html) is a flavour of markdown 
    * Embed R code

  * Writing a document is quick
    * But some flexibility and polish is lost
  
---

# Headers

All R markdown files start with a header
```
---
title: "My title"
author: "Me"
date: "01 June 2020"
output: html_document
---
```

---

# Header: output


  * `html_document` 

  * `pdf_document` - on windows you need [miktex](http://miktex.org/)

  * `word_document`

  * `ioslides_presentation` -- a html format for presentations.

  * `beamer_presentation` -- pdf

---

# R markdown (.Rmd)


  * Really easy
    * This presentation was written in Markdown

  * Start a line with `#` creates a level $1$ header
    * Surrounding text with `__` will make the text __bold__.

---

# Embedded R code with `knitr`

  * Supports multiple file types including markdown and LaTeX.

  * Allows a mixture of R and markdown
  
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../graphics/knit-logo.png")
```

---

# Chunks


* R code is treated exactly the same as using the normal R GUI interpreter
 
* Variables can be used to store results

* Graphs can be created

* Use routines from various packages

---

# Chunk options

Option name | Value | Effect 
------------|-------|-------
`eval` | logical | Whether to evaluate a code chunk 
`echo` | logical | Whether to include the source code in output
`include` | logical | Whether to include the chunk results in output 
`fig.width`, `fig.height` | `numeric` | Dimensions of plots in inches


---

# Processing a .Rmd file

  * Using RStudio, click `Knit HTML`

  * Or at the command line 
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("file.Rmd")
```

# `htmlwidgets`
---

## htmlwidgets

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
# initiate a 100 x 3 matrix filled with zeros
m <- matrix(numeric(300), ncol = 3)
# simulate a 3D random-walk
for (i in 2:100) m[i, ] <- m[i-1, ] + rnorm(3)
# collect everything in a data-frame
df <- setNames(
  data.frame(m, seq(1, 100)),
  c("x", "y", "z", "time")
)
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data=df, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, color = ~time, type = "scatter3d")
```

---

## htmlwidgets
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
library(plotly)
data("diamonds", package="ggplot2")
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 500), ]
d$clarity = paste("Clarity:", d$clarity)
plot_ly(d, x = ~carat, y = ~price, text = ~clarity,
        mode = "markers", color = ~carat, size = ~carat)
```

---

## htmlwidgets

* Used just like conventional R plots;

* Included in R Markdown documents;

* Incorporated into shiny web applications.

* Using an existing R html widgets requires very little code.

# `flexdashboard`
---

## flexdashboard: Dashboard creation

  * Interactive JavaScript data visualisations based on htmlwidgets.

  * R graphical output including base, lattice, and grid graphics.

  * Tabular data (with optional sorting, filtering, and paging).

  * Value boxes for highlighting important summary data.

  * Gauges for displaying values on a meter within a specified range

  * Text annotations of various kinds.

---

## Layouts

The `flexdashboard` package makes it easy to create dashboards. 
  
   * Single column (fill and scrolling);
   * Rows;
   * Multiple columns;
   * Tabs;
   * Pages.
  
New chart panes are created using `###` and new columns (or rows) are created using `------------------`

---

## Sizing
  
 * We can also change the sizes of dashboard panes.

 * If no size  attributes are specified then each chart size is relative to it's
    `knit`

 * To specify the size, we use the `data-width` and `data-height` attributes to rows, columns, or even individual
    charts.

 * These attributes establish the _relative_ size
    between charts laid out in the same dimension.
