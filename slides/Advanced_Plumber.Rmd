# 3 easy steps

  - 1: Write function
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  silly = function(stuff) {
    print(stuff)
  }
  ```

---

# 3 easy steps

  - 2: Add special comments

  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  library(plumber)
  
  @get /silly
  silly = function(stuff) {
    print(stuff)
  }
  ```

# My use cases

  - Providing forecasting interface for disease outbreak detection.
  
  - Providing recommendation algorithm for business.
  
  - Exposing SEO algorithms for marketing developers.

---

# Deployment Basic

  - Start with built in digital ocean method*
  
  - Entry point $5 per month
  
  - `plumber::do_deploy_api`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rage1.jpg")
```

---

# Deployment Advanced

  - install web server manually and configure resources (Docker Compose or pm2)*
  
  - multiple R processes running concurrently
  
  - harder to do but more scaleable

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rage2.jpg")
```

.footnote[[*] Plumber Docs https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html]

---
  
# Deployment Experimental

  - Configure app engine on Google Cloud Compute*
  
  - Harder, less support but most scaleable and fully managed

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rage3.png")
```

# Getting bitcoin price

```{r}
url = "https://api.gdax.com/products/BTC-GBP/candles"
results = httr::GET(url)
httr::content(results)[[1]]
```

# Task

1. Browse the internet for an API that you would like to use. 
    - app.swaggerhub.com
    - www.programmableweb.com

2. Use `httr::GET()` and `httr::content()` to make some calls.
